# Overview of Project #
The purpose of this Project is to analyze the School district's report to determine the academic dishonesty of grades for 9th Grade Students of Thomas High School, for Maths and Reading Scores. We are going to determine this by replacing the Maths and Reading Score for the above with averages from Grade 10-12. We will then compare this with the initial unmodified results. 

The analysis required the following data to be presented:
1. To replace the math scores and reading scores with NaN of Ninth grade for Thomas High School.
2. Recreate the following metrics:
    - The district summary.
    - The school summary.
    - The top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate.
    - The average math score for each grade level from each school.
    - The average reading score for each grade level from each school.
    - The average reading score for each grade level from each school.

# Resources #
Data Source: students_complete.csv, schools_complete.csv  <br>
Software: Python, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook <br>
Library Modules: Pandas, Numpy, Scipy.stats.

# Results #
We were able to conclude the following from our analysis:
- District Summary Overview (i.e. Effects of Cleaning Up Data) <br>
The Updated Summary (i.e. cleand up data) indicates the following:
  - Average Math Score dropped by 0.01
  - Average Reading Score didn't change
  - Passing Math % dropped by 0.2%
  - Passing Reading % dropped by 0.3%
  - Overall Passing Percentage dropped by 0.1%
<br>
The effect of cleaning up the code had nominal impact on the outcome.
